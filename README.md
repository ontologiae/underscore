Underscore doesn't manage structural equality in all of its functions.
Structural equality in all function like uniq, intersection, etc.. in serious functional language is the default behavior.
This fork fix this mistake.
                                                                               





Underscore.js is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides 
support for the usual functional suspects (each, map, reduce, filter...) 
without extending any core JavaScript objects.
